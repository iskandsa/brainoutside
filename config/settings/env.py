"""Typed env-var loader.

Replaces ad-hoc `os.environ.get()` calls scattered across `settings/`.
Values come from the OS env first, then `.env`, then declared defaults.
Required-in-prod fields are enforced by `assert_prod_safe()`, which is
called from `prod.py` so boot fails fast (`ImproperlyConfigured`) rather
than at first request.

Sensitive values use `SecretStr` so they redact in `__repr__` and any log
that interpolates the Settings object.

Usage:
    from config.settings.env import settings
    SECRET_KEY = settings.SECRET_KEY.get_secret_value()
